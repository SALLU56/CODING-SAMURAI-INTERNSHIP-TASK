# CODING SAMURAI INTERNSHIP TASK

## 📊 Project : Logistic Regression on Titanic Dataset

This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Coding Samurai**.  
The goal was to build a **Logistic Regression** model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like Age, Sex, and Passenger Class.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- ✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- ✅ Feature Engineering (encoding categorical variables, handling missing values)
- ✅ Logistic Regression modeling
- ✅ Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
- ✅ Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- ✅ Working with Jupyter Notebook and GitHub

---

## 📁 Dataset
- The dataset used is the classic **Titanic Dataset** available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).
- Columns used: `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`, `Survived` (target)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📌 Summary of Results
- Preprocessed the data: handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and dropped irrelevant columns.
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model to predict survival.
- Achieved around **81% accuracy** on test data.
- Insights: Female passengers and 1st class passengers had a higher chance of survival.
