# CODING SAMURAI INTERNSHIP TASK

## 📊 Project : Linear Regression on Simple Dataset

This project was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Coding Samurai**.  
The goal was to build a simple linear regression model to predict **Sales** based on **TV advertising spend** using Python and Scikit-learn.
