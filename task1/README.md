🚀 Linear Regression on Advertising Dataset
Coding Samurai – Data Science Internship Task

This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at Coding Samurai.
The objective was to build a Simple Linear Regression model to predict Sales based on TV advertising spend using Python and Scikit-learn.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Linear Regression Modeling
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Pandas)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib)
Model Evaluation (MSE, R² Score)
Jupyter Notebook Workflow
GitHub Version Control

📁 Dataset Overview

The project uses the popular Advertising Dataset, commonly used for introductory machine learning tasks.
Columns:
TV – TV advertising spend
Radio – Radio advertising spend
Newspaper – Newspaper advertising spend
Sales – Product sales

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

📌 Project Workflow

Loaded and explored the dataset
Removed unnecessary columns
Selected TV as the independent variable and Sales as the dependent variable
Split data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets
Trained a Linear Regression model
Evaluated performance using:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Visualized predictions using scatter plot and regression line

📊 Summary of Results

Successfully trained a linear regression model to estimate sales from TV advertising spend.
Obtained a strong linear relationship between advertisement investment and sales.
Visualized actual vs predicted results for better interpretation.

🏁 Outcome

This project strengthened my understanding of:
✔ Machine Learning fundamentals
✔ Regression models
✔ Data analysis workflow
✔ Real-world implementation of scikit-learn
